# __Introduction and Motivation__ :
When we need to update we need to preserve backward compitibility when updating 
android applicationsto make sure that all applications are working under deprecation for this problem such approach we require an automate update in depricated API.

## _Research Methodology_: 
		For this Purpose we will used Appevolve to automated android API update before and after-Updateand creating generic patches in this example some limitations in requires before and after update.API require manuall configuration for update .In the target file to be updated similar syntax,So due to two reasons so theywill decide to robust automated coccinelle and symantic patch for readable transformation coccinelle 4j recent java part for coccinelle j4 and programme matching for transformation tool that is used to add in their revolution to scanning coccevolve used to code normalization coccievolve requires single after update example.
#### Evalute the performance of coccievolve 
### __Experiment and App Evolve__: The Evalution on 112 target files with 10 different API is accquired from github.

## _Results_:The Aim of the Coccievolve which overcome the limitations of appevolve and code normalization mitigate 
syntatic differences,And requires a single after update.
for denormalization to remove the temporary variables.
